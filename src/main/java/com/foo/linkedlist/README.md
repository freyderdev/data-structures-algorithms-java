# ðŸ§  Linked List Problems

This section includes classic interview problems related to **singly linked lists**, solved in Java. Each folder contains:

- A clear problem description
- A solution using the most appropriate technique
- Comments and explanation of time/space complexity

| N-th Node from End                | `d_nth_node_to_last`   | Two Pointers           | O(n)       | O(1)       | Fast-slow pointer approach     |
| Add Two Numbers                   | `e_add_two_numbers`    | Simultaneous Traversal | O(n)       | O(n)       | Handles carry as in addition   |
| Swap Nodes in Pairs               | `f_swap_nodes_in_pairs`| Pointer Manipulation   | O(n)       | O(1)       | Recursive and iterative versions|
